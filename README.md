how to use it:
1. first of all get your access token
2. make a directory named /src and put there some images
3. make a directory named /templates and put there some templates with empty places in it
4. put data for every particular template in the code, that being said - sizes, points, max_srcs (idk might add more clever way in the future rather than hardcoding it lmao)
5. there u go
